This is a first project from the Odin Project.

The goal is to recreate the google homepage with HTML and CSS.

First Attempt:
I have started the index.html file. I have added the logo and the seach bar and centered them after looking up how to use the flex positioning for css.

I have finished the bulk of the assignement. I used flexboxes in the layout of the page. Though, I did run into some difficulty with using flexbox to layout everything as I liked. 

Second Attempt:
After watching a few videos on layouts with flexbox I decided to try to redo the page. 

I completely rewrote the css, and added some extras like box shadows, and working links. 

Overall I think with was a great first project to get familiar with writing html and css.
